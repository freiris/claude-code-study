1. code hierarchy, input and output
(1) batch_prompts_with_trace.py is the main function to call, run it with python-3.10 in virtual environment (e.g., conda).
(2) coin_change.py, customer_order.sql and buggy_quick_sort.py are inputs which are generated by Claude.
(3) coin_change_with_unit_test.py, customer_order_optimized.sql and fixed_quick_sort.py are outputs after Claude Code processes the prompts, claude_results.yaml saves the results of all prompts with detailed messages.
(4) claude_trace.log is the log file for tracing, which records the function calls.

2. setup tips
(1) to use Claude Code, you should get a Pro plan in Claude.ai, then you can use it in terminal (with command ./claude), you may need a foreign credit card (e.g., VISA card in USA or Canada) to pay the bill.
(2) to use the python sdk for Claude Code, you further need the API Console credits (pay for it separately) and get an api-key. Note that Claude Code and API Console are different. 
(3) put the api-key in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc as environment variable, source it in terminal. 
(4) set up a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv), and install nodejs, python-3.10, claude, claude-code-sdk, etc.
(5) ask Claude or ChatGPT for any exceptions and mistakes, take a look at Youtube tutorial videos, for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1bRZaHH24&t=1049s, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lue8K2jqfKk.
